# To Do
As a user of your alarm clock, I would like to be able to view the current time.
I would also like to be able to enter a time into a form to set an alarm.
The alarm should turn on at the specified alarm time.
As a user, when the alarm turns on I want it to either show me something on the screen (like a picture/animation) or make a sound, or both.
